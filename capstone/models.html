    <p><b>Methods</p></b>

<p>Western wildfires in Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming were filtered for using dplyr functions from FTM_fires.csv. This wildfires list was then used to process the individual tree data down to all western trees within the dataset. This resulted in 76,012 records. After removing all NAs for tree condition from year 1 - 5 and variables of interest, 14862 individual tree counts remained for further use in building the logistic regression models.
</p>
<p>The variables of interest were height (<i>HT_m</i>), DBH (<i>DBH_cm</i>), crown volume scorch percent (<i>CVS_percent</i>), bark char average (<i>BCA</i>) and beetle presence (<i>BTLBeetle Present</i>). Because of the collinearity between height and DBH, two separate models were visualized where the difference between them was whether height or DBH was included. Model 2 with height has the lower AIC value which suggest it is the better model between the two
</p>
<p><b>Model 1: DBH</p></b>


<p>In this model, the following variables were utilized: DBH, crown volume scorch percent, bark char average and beetle presence. All variables have a positive effect of raising the probability of death of conifers within five years of a fire. In the presence of beetles, the mortality probability almost doubles. As both DBH and crown volume scorch increases, the mortality of conifers also increases and levels off after 75% crown volume scorch. Bark char average also has an additive effect to mortality in conjunction with all other variables.

Running the glm function, all variables are significant for a significance threshold of α < 0.05. The table below summarizes the coefficient values and associated p-value of each tree condition variable used in the model.

<p><b>Model 2: Height</p></b>

<p>In this model, height, crown volume scorch percent, bark char average and beetle presence were used. Similarly to model 1, all variables increase the probability of mortality of the trees within five years. Height and crown volume scorch have greater effects on the model than DBH and crown volume scorch. When crown volume scorch and bark char average are compared together, mortality starts to level off around 75% crown volume scorch. As height increases with greater bark char, mortality is almost 100% probability in the presence of beetles. 

Running the glm function, all variables are significant for a significance threshold of α < 0.05. The table below summarizes the coefficient values and associated p-value of each tree condition variable used in the model.

    <p><b>Discussion</p></b>
	<p>Tree mortality after fire increases greatly when outbreaks of beetles have been present. Especially after disturbances, the weakened trees are more susceptible to bark beetle attacks due to stress. In addition, larger trees both in DBH and height have a greater mortality rate compared to smaller trees in these models. This is consistent with literature found about the mortality patterns in mixed conifer forest systems (Ganey and Vojta, Smith et al.). Fire injury as noted by the bark char and crown volume scorch are also key indicators of post-fire mortality. Cambium damage prevents photosynthates to move throughout the tree while crown scorch reduces the photosynthetic capacity and causes the tree to reach into reserves to maintain and heal (Hood and Varner). As fires persist on the landscape and change the forest composition in the West, it is important to understand the dynamics of mortality within these systems and adapt management to ensure the survival of the larger conifers in the western US.
