    <h4 class="section-heading"><a href='#'>Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument Conservation Proposal</a></h4>
    <p>Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, also known as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), is the largest single conservation area protected in the United States. Covering over 583,000 square miles, this location also encompasses the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and extends the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve. Conservation efforts in the area have been centered on recovering the population of Hawaiian Monk Seals. Overall, four agencies as Co-trustees manage the preservation of history and prevent further environmental damages in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. Having both cultural and ecological significance, this reserve is largely secured from development and tourism. There have been debates though, that the priority of conservation led to the neglect of sustaining historical sites. The effects of multiple stakeholders and values will thus be explored with consideration of the influences that scientific evidence and history of the NWHI provides...

    <h4 class="section-heading"><a href='#'>Bigfoot Conservation Proposal</a></h4>
    <p>
    In Humboldt County, people have been reporting bigfoot sightings for centuries. In collaboration with the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), we are now working together to discover the true extent of possible bigfoot habitat as well as areas that need further protection. Using GIS technology, we are combining gathered data with environmental factors to determine the geographic distribution of bigfoot during the summer and winter months. We are aiming to create thorough habitat suitability maps for bigfoot from the known features. Furthermore, through a generous donation, BFRO will be able to buy key land parcels that will become safe reserves for bigfoot. In addition to the habitat suitability maps, the other goal is to discern which land to purchase for these establishments...

    <h4 class="section-heading"><a href='#'>Venado Declaration (Timber Products)</a></h4>
    <p>How and where do we implement the urgent actions called for in the Venado Declaration to encourage and incentivize expansion of infrastructure to enable a substantial and rapid increase in timberland management to protect communities and improve forest health? We propose potential locations and types of timber mills that can process low value material in order to deal with the biomass build up in the Shasta and Siskiyou counties. We also Propose a more sustainable method of product transport via electric semis and local cogeneration plants to increase the ability of exporting wood residual products...  </p>

    <h4 class="section-heading"><a href='#'>Forests for Amphibians: Land Use Threats on California Amphibian Species</a></h4>
    <p>There are over 8,000 species of amphibians existing around the world, of which 88 can be found in California. Due to their sensitivity to environmental and water quality changes, amphibian decline is an indicator for the health of the ecosystem. One major threat to amphibian species is habitat alteration which reduces available breeding grounds and disrupts juvenile dispersion.  In California, there are two high amphibian biodiversity areas, categorized as locations with at least a species richness of 10.  In this study, I characterized the projected land cover changes in four counties (Humboldt, Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Trinity) to answer how changes in land use types in Northern California affect the extent of the high species richness region. The hypothesis is that the conversion of forestlands to developed areas would cause the biodiversity hotspot to diminish in size. From the Land-use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS), I extracted land type data for every decade from 2020 until 2100 under the high population growth scenario. After determining the total area of each land classification using geospatial tools, the greatest conversion of land was towards perennial agriculture and only 21 km2 projected for development. Forest, grassland, and shrubland had a cumulative decrease of 174 km2. Though developed areas are not predicted to greatly decrease the biodiverse area, expanding agriculture poses a similar risk for amphibians. If however the current protected forest areas remain, amphibian richness can be preserved despite agricultural pressures. Further research must be conducted to determine how the changing climate and wildfire risk broaden future assessment of at-risk habitat ranges...

    <h4 class="section-heading"><a href='#'>Tree Mortality: Interactions between Fire and Beetles</a></h4>
    <p>Wildfires burn millions of acres of forested lands in the Western United States annually. Not only does the severity of fires affect initial tree mortality rates, but it also interacts with other environmental factors that influence delayed mortality. Much research focus on characterizing fire interactions with forest disturbances such as bark beetles, climate change and pathogens (Kane et al. 2017). In order to further examine the effects of bark beetles on post-fire tree mortality, we utilized The Fire and Tree Mortality (FTM) Database complied on the US Forest Service Research Data Archive. The dataset can be accessed here and additional information can be found in the corresponding peer-reviewed article. We attempt to explore two major questions with the individual tree records in the FTM. The first is how bark beetle presence change tree survival rates within 3 years of a wildfire. The second question is to what extent do bark beetles determine the severity of injury that trees sustain from the fire. Overall, we focus on fires that occurred in the western United States, which is prone to extreme fire events...
